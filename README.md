## Installing dependencies
So, since *nix allows you to get the answer from a command and then apply this in another command, a convenient option would be `cat requirements.txt | xargs npm install`.

However, you can always use `npm install config nodemon telegraf` to install dependencies. But, to me, this is not the most convenient option ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Preparing sources and starting the bot
1. Clone bot's sources with `git clone https://github.com/Attorelle/catdumbs/`
2. Fill out values in [default.json.example](https://github.com/Attorelle/catdumbs/tree/default/config/default.json.example) and rename it to `default.json`
3. And now... \*drumroll\* You are ready to `npm start`!
