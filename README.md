## Installing dependencies
So, since *nix allows you to get the answer from a command and then apply this in another command, a convenient option would be `cat requirements.txt | xargs npm install`.

However, you can always use `npm install config nodemon telegraf` to install dependencies. But, to me, this is not the most convenient option ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
